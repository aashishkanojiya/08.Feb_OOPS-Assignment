Abstract base classes can include abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass. This is helpful to ensure that derived classes follow a certain structure.\n\nThe Uses of abc module in python are as follows:-\n1.Defining Interfaces: To define a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract base class.\n2.Enforcing Consistency: Ensures that certain methods are consistently implemented across various subclasses.\n3.Preventing Instantiation: Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, which enforces the creation of subclasses.",

The abc module in Python is handy for this.\n3.Encapsulation: Hide the internal state of the object by using private attributes (e.g., prefixed with double underscores __) and provide public methods to access and modify them.",
